Supported devices
=================

All OCPP 1.6j compatible devices should be supported, but not every device offers the same level of functionality. So far, we've tried:

## ABB Terra AC chargers

ABB Terra AC chargers with firmware version 1.8.21 and earlier fail to respond correctly when OCPP measurands are automatically detected by the OCPP integration. As of this writing, ABB has been notified, but no corresponding firmware fix is available.

### Issue Description

When automatic measurand detection is used in the OCPP integration with ABB Terra AC chargers:

1. The charger responds as if it supports all proposed measurands.
2. The integration then asks for all measurands to be reported.
3. When the integration tries to query which measurands are available after this configuration, the ABB Terra AC reboots.

As a result, the ABB charger becomes unusable with the OCPP integration, as the integration checks for available measurands on every charger boot, leading to a boot loop.

For more details and symptoms, see [Issue #1275](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp/issues/1275).

### Workaround

Fortunately, it is possible to configure the charger using manual configuration and to restore correct settings.

To use these chargers:

1. Disable "Automatic detection of OCPP Measurands".
   - Note: Automatic detection is enabled by default. Until configuration changes can be made online, you may need to remove the devices from this integration and add them again.
   - If "Automatic detection of OCPP Measurands" is disabled during configuration, you will be presented with a list of possible measurands.

2. When presented with the list of measurands, select only the following:
   - `Current.Import`
   - `Current.Offered`
   - `Energy.Active.Import.Register`
   - `Power.Active.Import`
   - `Voltage`

This list is based on the overview of OCPP 1.6 implementation for ABB Terra AC (firmware 1.6.6).

## [Etrel - Inch Pro](https://etrel.com/charging-solutions/inch-pro/)
To allow a custom OCPP server such as HA to set up a transaction ID, it is necessary to set under Users > Charging Authorization the
authorization type to either `Central system only` or `Charger whitelist and central system` otherwise the OCPP integration won't
match transactions and it won't report some meter values such as session time.

All basic functions work properly

## [Teison Smart MINI Wallbox](https://www.teison.com/ac_smart_mini_ev_wallbox.html)
Use *My Teison* app to enable webSocket. In the socket URL field enter the address of your Home Assistant server including the port. In the socket port field enter *ocpp1.6* for insecure connection or *socpp1.6* for secure connection with certificates. Once enabled, charger doesn't connect to the vendor server anymore and can be controlled only from Home Assistant or locally via Bluetooth.

Even though the device accepts all measurands, the working ones are 
   - `Current.Import`
   - `Energy.Active.Import.Register`
   - `Power.Active.Import`
   - `Temperature`
   - `Voltage`

If the devices loses connection to Home Assistant (due to Wi-Fi disconnection or update, for example) it doesn't seem to reconnect automatically. It is necessary to reboot the charger via Bluetooth for it to reconnect.

## Others
When a charger is not listed as a supported charger it simply means that it has not been reported to work. Whether it will work or not in practice really depends on whether it is compliant with the OCPP standard. Some vendors claim their device is compliant without bothering to do a compliance test, because that takes time and costs money!

When it is fully compliant, then it should work out of the box, since the ocpp integration is designed to work for fully compliant chargers. Any issues should be reported, and we will do out best to analyze them. In some cases modifications or workarounds may be needed. As long as these workarounds do not break compliance to the OCPP standard they can be added to this repository.
Otherwise, we urge you to request your vendor to update their firmware to make their device OCPP compliant.

You can always make your own fork of this repository to solve issues for a specific device that are not OCPP compliant. However, we will not integrate these type of changes into this repository, because that may prevent other chargers to work.
