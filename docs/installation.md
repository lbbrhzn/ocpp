### Secure Connection
If using [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/letsencrypt), [Duck DNS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/duckdns/) or other add-ons that enables HTTPS you can get a secure WWS connection for OCPP. For more information on how to generate keys [see this blog post](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2017/09/27/effortless-encryption-with-lets-encrypt-and-duckdns/).
- The option secure connection enables connection thru WSS (HTTPS). With the option disabled the connection will be WS (HTTP).
- If enabled provide pathways to SSL certificate and key files. The pathways will be ignored if secure connection is disabled.

### Measurands
- Select which measurands you would like to become available as sensor entities.
- Most chargers only support a subset of all possible measurands. This depends most on the Feature profiles that are supported by the charger.

- An entity will have the value 'Unavailable' until the charger successfully connects.
- An entity will have the value 'Unknown' until its value has been read from the charger.

## Configure your Charger

- Configure your charger to use the OCPP websocket of your Central System (e.g. ws://homeassistant.local:9000). This is charger specific, so consult your manual.
- Some chargers require the protocol section 'ws://' to be removed, or require the url to end with a '/'.
- Some chargers require the url to be specified as an IP address, i.e. '192.168.178.1:9000'
- You may need to reboot your charger before the changes become effective.
